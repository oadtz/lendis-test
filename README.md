There are some areas of improvement that I planned to do but did not complete in 2 hours.
- If the cart is empty, we should display the message "Your cart is empty" to the user.
- With the current implementation, the cart data is stored in the browser's memory which we can make it more persistently with sessionStorage or localStorage for a better user experience.
- The product list is loaded from the static data file, we can load the list from API.

To run the code, please execute these commands.
$ npm install
$ npm start
Then go to http://localhost:3000 with your browser.
